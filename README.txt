Bootstrap - A base-theme for Drupal

By default, this base theme enables and uses a CDN for loading the Bootstrap library. If you disable this CDN, you will need to use an alternative solution for adding the necessary CSS and JS files from the Bootstrap library. This can be in the form creating a sub-theme or using a utility module.
